# DINAMO-Technical-task
# Project Title

This repository contains the database schema design and documentation for a multi-application support backend system. It serves as a foundational resource for the development of a backend using NestJS, MongoDB, and Elasticsearch.

## Overview

The project encompasses:

- **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)**: Visual representation of the database structure and relationships between entities.
- **Documentation PDFs**: Detailed descriptions of the database design considerations, indexing strategies, and the integration of Elasticsearch.

## Files

- `ERD.png` or `ERD.pdf`: Entity-Relationship Diagram of the database schema.
- `Documentation.pdf`: Comprehensive documentation outlining the database design, including considerations for soft deletes, user roles, product models, and Elasticsearch implementation.

## Features

- Multi-application support for consumers, riders, and vendors.
- Soft delete functionality for user management.
- Unique user and product model structures.

## Technologies that should be used

- **NestJS**: Backend framework.
- **MongoDB**: Primary database.
- **Elasticsearch**: For enhanced searching capabilities.
